# psl_cricinfo_scrapper

## Introduction
This repo contains code to scrape the code for each of the 5 editions of PSL using cricinfo. The code consists of a single jupyter notebook that you can run to extract all the data and store it as a CSV.

## Upading with new Data

The second cell contains the link to all PSL series match result page. If you plan to run this code in the future on new versions of PSL, please just make an entry into the dictionary `psl_urls` with the new year and its cricinfo result page URL. 

## Code Explanation
The code is quite straight forward and there are basic comments, if you still have questions feel free to hit me up on my twitter @hj576
